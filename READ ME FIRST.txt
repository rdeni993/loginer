Loginer

============================
============================

** Main purpose of this script is to help new ( read beginners ) PHP programmers
   to create login process in their own applications.

** Loginer Class take control on whole process include creating forms for 
   signup and login..

** All you need to do is to config you configuration script located inside 
   inc/ folder...

** Before you start application please follow this instructions... 

DATABASE
========

** First part of configuration application is to setup database.
   Setup is located inside file:

   inc/db_mysql.inc.php 

** Add fields you know:

    - host,
    - username,
    - password,
    - database_name => This must be name for already created database..

APPLICATION
============

** After you finish database setup you need to configurate application.
   First you need to configure database table.

    App configuration file is located inside: 

    inc/conf.inc.php ( It is recommanded to copy this file )

** Steps to create simple login app :

    1) This application will create database table automat. for itself.
       Add name of table in this line of code:
       
       $_conf['db_table_name'] = "loginer";

    2) Add fields you want to have in database and in signup form.

        $_conf['db_table_data'] = [

            "user_name"     => [ "varchar", 255 ],
            "user_surname"  => [ "varchar", 255 ],
            "user_email"    => [ "varchar", 255 ],
            "user_password" => [ "varchar", 255 ]

        ];

        This is example where you have 4 fields inside signup form.

    3) On of these fields must be unique.. Best solution in this example is
       to make email a unique for every user...
       
        $_conf['db_table_unique'] = "user_email";

        *NOTE: This must be part of array above... Please do not leave this empty
        or add more then one value...

    4) Some type of data like password must be hashed because of securitiy issues.. To crypt this 
       fields there is array with sensitive data...

       $_conf['db_table_sens'] =  [ "user_password" ];

       In this array you can add more then one element but one must be leave unhashed... 

       *NOTE: Its recommanded to add only password in this array..

    5) Signup form have few input fields, user can forget to add one or more.. If you want to protect app 
       from this issues keep this field disabled..
        
       $_conf['db_table_allow_empty'] = false;

       This will return error if user have any input field empty... 

    6) Password Algorithm is place where you can decide which algorithm you will use to crypt 
       password data.. 
        
       $_conf['password_algorithm'] = PASSWORD_BCRYPT;

       *NOTE: All available algorithms are written in comment above.. Try to use only 
       algorithms we have tested..

    7) Password salt will kepp your hashed data more secured... You can put any value you want..

       $_conf['password_salt'] = "vGA1O9wmRjrwAVXD98HNOgsNpDczlqm3Jq7KnEd1rVAGv3Fykk1a";

    8) After we prepared everything for signup we need to provide login form. This is place where website 
       users do log in our app... In this app you need only to enter fields from array above.. In my example 
       these fields are  user email and user password...

        $_conf['login_fields'] = [
            "user_email",
            "user_password"
        ];

    9) At the end add page where user will come after login to page.. Login and Signup Page will not be allowed 
       at the time user is logged in.. After User logout it will become useable again...

        $_conf['login_land_page'] = 'website.php';

    10) My advice is to keep this folder separeted from your other files so you can create login URL simple by redirecting user 
        to loginer folder...

RUN APPLICATION
===============

    Before you start using this script run it using url... In my example this app is located inside folder "login"

    myapp/

        css/
        img/
        js/
        login/ => this is loginer folder just renamed to login 
        inc/
        index.php 


    In this case i start app just running

    http://localhost/login/

    This will call login/index.php and configure application.. If everything is finished you wll see 
    welcome message.. After you confirm using button you will be redirecting to login page... 


    I hope you will enjoy in app....
